# Evaluation of CASP16 Results

For the Top-5 models submitted by MULTICOM predictors, the native scores are obtained from the CASP16 website and stored in the `raw_data/official` directory. For in-house models without native scores from the CASP16 website, we provide the native scores, which were calculated using the programs in the `analysis/src` directory and stored in `raw_data/inhouse`.

The evaluation codes are provided in `analysis/assembly` and `analysis/monomer`.

The protein structural models generated by the MULTICOM4 software for the CASP16 assembly targets, along with their native scores, are available in PSBench[1]: [https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/75SZ1U](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/75SZ1U).

For the CASP16 monomeric targets, the generated protein structural models and their native scores (e.g., TM-score and GDT-TS) are available here: [https://zenodo.org/records/15588162](https://zenodo.org/records/15588162).

## Note
Due to data restrictions from CASP16, we are unable to release all the protein structures used in the analysis. Therefore, we have provided the evaluation results in separate folders.
